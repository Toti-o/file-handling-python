This program does two main things:

Reads and modifies a file

The program asks the user for a filename.

It opens the file and reads the content.

The content is then modified (turned into uppercase).

The modified text is saved into a new file with the name modified_filename.txt.

Handles errors safely

If the file does not exist → it shows: "Error: File not found."

If there is no permission to read the file → it shows: "Error: You don't have permission."

Any other unexpected problem will also be shown, without crashing the program.

✅ Outcome

By running this program, you can safely read, edit, and save files. If something goes wrong, the program will tell you what happened instead of just stopping with an error.
